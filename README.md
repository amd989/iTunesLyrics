iTunesLyrics
============

Based on a previous version of iTunesLyrics Importer, I modified the code so that it continues to retrieve lyrics from lyrics wikia. Previously removed by the original author due to lyrics wikia removing support of their lyrics APIs.

Now I just crawl the site, nothing fancy but gets the job done. 

If you have any comment or question just let me know on the issues section
